This source code is used to find the AMNOI metric (for programs in different languages like c++,c#) that is stated in the paper
"Some structural measures of API usability".

How to calculate AMNOI(API Method Name Overload Index) metric
	G = {G1,G2,.....GN}
	where G1,G2,......GN are disjoint sets of overloaded methods and Gj is a set of overloaded methods with same name
	
	AMNOI(Gj) = 1 - ((|Return(m)|-1)/(|Gj|-1))
	where Return(m) is set of return types of a paritucular method m
	|X| represents number of elements in the set X
	
	AMNOI = (AMNOI(G1)+AMNOI(G2)+......+AMNOI(GN))/N

System Requirements:
	LINUX operating system with g++, lex and amke packaes installed
