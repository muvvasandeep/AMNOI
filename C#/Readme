This source code is used to find the AMNOI metric for c# programs that is stated in the paper "Some structural measures of API usability".

How to calculate AMNOI(API Method Name Overload Index) metric
	G = {G1,G2,.....GN}
	where G1,G2,......GN are disjoint sets of overloaded methods and Gj is a set of overloaded methods with same name
	
	AMNOI(Gj) = 1 - ((|Return(m)|-1)/(|Gj|-1))
	where Return(m) is set of return types of a paritucular method m
	|X| represents number of elements in the set X
	
	AMNOI = (AMNOI(G1)+AMNOI(G2)+......+AMNOI(GN))/N

System Requirements:
	UNIX operating system with g++, lex and amke packaes installed

Note:
	Before finding the AMNOI metric make sure that source code is syntactically correct because this code doesnot check for syntactical correctness.

Instructions for executing the code:
	step1: copy the source program for which AMNOI metric is to be found to input.cs file
	step2: run make command
	step3: run ./AMNOI input.cs to get the AMNOI metric for your source code
		where AMNOI is the name of the executable file formed when make command is executed
		AMNOI metric of individual methods and for the whole program is displayed on the screen
	step4: run make clean command to remove all the extra files formed when make command is executed
